    <br>
    <br>
    <p align="center">
        I'm incredibly grateful for this courseâ€”it has opened doors to a whole new world in web development. Before
        this, coding was a foreign language to me. Now, I'm proud to say that I can build a website (even if it takes a
        bit of time!). This is just the beginning; there's so much more to uncover and learn, so many exciting
        possibilities to explore.

        I've realized that as a designer, having coding skills is invaluable. It's a tool that enhances creativity and
        enables me to bring my visions to life in the digital realm. Inspired by authors like J.R. Carpenter who
        advocate for personal websites, I'm determined to nurture this skill further.

        There's a lot of self-imposed exercises I plan to tackle. I want to ensure I don't lose touch with this
        language. Creating websites is not just a skill but a creative outlet that I'm eager to delve deeper into.

        Thank you for the journey, and here's to embracing the endless learning ahead!
    </p>
