    <h2 class="sunhead">1.What is the thesis of this article</h2>
    <p>The thesis of the article “ What screens want” is a journey of the evolution of screens over the years, drawing
        relations between the history and developments of photography and filmmaking. The author further explains that
        screens as a medium for interaction and interface that have a fundamental nature of “grain” that is
        characterized by the capacity of change, much like wood or plastic, which the author refers to as “flux". The
        author further illustrates different levels of flux, from small mutations to immersive interactions, and
        emphasizes the significance of managing change in design.

    <p> The article also criticizes the current state of the web, highlighting how commercial interests and
        inappropriate structures have distorted the true potential. Of the digital landscape. It emphasizes a new vision
        of the web, a shift from privatization, power hierarchies and surveillance to extensibility, openness,
        communication, community and wildness. Towards the end, the author encourages a shift towards a more
        user-centric, intuitive and open designs that align with human values and aspirations.

    <h2 class="sunhead">2. .Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo?</h2>
    <p>
        The article introduces two ideological camps namely flat design and skeuomorphs.

        Where the former believers propose the use of 2D visual elements since they justify the inherit flatness of the
        screen, hence it should be devoid of 3D elements whereas the latter suggests it should resemble real-world
        objects and mimic the materials and textures to create a sense of familiarity with their functions and
        performance.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>While my personal inclination is towards a blend of both approaches, the ideal choice should be dictated by the
        specific requirements of the design rather than personal preference.It essential to consider what the design
        requires with feedback from the users and inputs from the client because it depends upon how intuitive it is for
        the user and how the design aligns with the values and principles of the company. But then again I would
        probably use both flat and skeuomorphs and calibrate the percentage of each according to the user needs and the
        organization's vision.

    <h2 class="sunhead">3. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another
        example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.

    </h2>
    <p>
        The authors introduces the invention of the device creating the illusion of motion through a series of images.
        It was invented by Eadweard Muybridge, a pioneer in motion photography in the late 19th century. His first
        attempts to set time in motion were to print the high-speed photographs radially on a glass disc and spin it
        while it was lit from behind.It was an important precursor to modern motion picture technology and screens in
        itself.

        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p> The relevance of zoopraxiscope is related to web design as it represents the early stages of motion graphics and
        animation. In the modern web, the use of motion and animation enhances the experience and interactions with the
        web providing guidance, feedback and engagement with the web.



        A film technique example that has made its way into digital design involves an expressive rendition of 3D
        elements. Films use 3D glasses to manipulate layers, and in digital design, this translates to creatively
        presenting elements emerging from confined spaces or boxes. Additionally, techniques like slow motion in films
        have been adopted to enhance visual storytelling in digital design. Even coding features like the "ease" option
        have been integrated to improve the flow and smoothness of digital interfaces.
