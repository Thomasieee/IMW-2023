    <h2 class="sunhead">1. What is the thesis of this article?</h2>
    <p>The author, J.R. Carpenter, a British-Canadian artist, writer and a researcher, introduces the term "handmade
        web" at the start of the article to help readers appreciate the beauty of human-made creations like zines and
        pamphlets and other manual print materials to draw a relation between them and the web pages that were crafted
        by individuals. During the mid to late 1990s, the author talks about how the web pages were often handcrafted,
        fostering personal connections and encouraging experimentation as opposed to the modern web, which is more
        controlled by corporations. It delves into the high commercialized web pages coded by softwares that lack
        creativity and personality.

    <p> The author further emphasizes the importance of owning their online identities by having personal websites
        rather than relying on big platforms. The article also suggests embracing slowness and smallness in the digital
        realm could act as a form of resistance against the highly commercialized and standardized modern web platforms.

    <h2 class="sunhead">2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is
        being resisted?</h2>
    <p>
        The author links the term “resistance” to today's highly controlled and profit driven nature of the contemporary
        web, where it is being dominated by a few giants. It refers to the resistance against this dominance by these
        large corporations over the interment which often prioritize profit over individual expression and creativity.
        It is the resistance against the dependence on major online platforms for online presence and content, and
        advocates the people to control and own their own identities and data through personal websites. It is the
        resistance against the depletion of DIY( Do It Yourself) ethos that build the early web space, which enabled
        individuals to be more intimate and creative, It is the resistance against the nature of digital content,
        highlighting the need to preserve and appreciate the longevity of digital creations in contrast to physical
        materials. It is the resistance against the trajectory the modern web is heading towards

    <h2 class="sunhead">3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the
        "physicality" of the web?

    </h2>
    <p>
        Humans naturally gravitate towards the tangible aspects of the physical world, as it's through our senses that
        we comprehend and relate to our surroundings. Hence, the modern internet strives to seamlessly merge the digital
        realm with the physical world. The rise of Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) showcases this
        convergence, allowing consumers to immerse themselves in environments that bridge the gap between the digital
        and the real. Virtual reality is fundamentally inspired from physical objects, aiming to create an experience
        where virtual entities feel remarkably real, evoking a sense of physically interacting with these virtual
        objects.

    <p> Wearable technology is a prime example of how the internet is now at our fingertips, literally. It has
        revolutionized our interaction with the digital space, making it portable and accessible wherever we go. The
        ability to have a wealth of information and connectivity at hand has become so integral that it's challenging to
        imagine our lives without it, and its impact on our sense of completeness and convenience.
