    <h1 align="center" class="title"> STORYBOOK PROCESS </h1>
    <h2 class="heading">Inspiration</h2>
    <p> Although my initial concept was quite different, I decided to create a completely new story using HTML and CSS,
        mainly because it aligns better with my coding skill level.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p> The inspiration for my storybook came from the ever-changing and vibrant Toronto clouds. Observing how their
        hues and shapes transformed with each passing moment, I realized that this could be a great creative
        opportunity. Thus, I conceived Maddie the Cloudy, an anthropomorphized cloud that would convey emotions through
        its colors.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>My journey started with a search on Pinterest for cloud illustrations to bring Maddie to life. The story
        originated in the experiences of international students who have recently joined OCAD, where many might go
        through loneliness, homesickness, or other challenges. As a response to these emotions, the central concept of
        my storybook emerged – the idea of "hugging."

    <h2 class="heading">Ideate</h2>
    <p>
        I carefully selected color tones from the exhibition that harmonize with the visual identity of the event,
        aiming for a sense of relatability. My creative process involved multiple iterations,
        all revolving around the central concept of the 13 yellow lines—a concept drawn directly
        from the objects within the exhibition.

        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p> These lines serve a dual purpose: capturing attention and encouraging further exploration
        by prompting viewers to scroll down for a deeper understanding of the event.<br>

    <h2 class="sunhead">Design</h2>
    <p>
        In the final design, my objective was to encapsulate the event's distinctive ambiance.
        To achieve this, I carefully curated interactive elements, consolidating them while allowing for ample empty
        space—a
        deliberate choice to mirror the expansive feel of the exhibition.
        Drawing inspiration from the <a href="https://canada-culture.org/en/">Canadian Cultural Center website</a>,
        I integrated a fixed yellow panel on the side, aiming to establish a visual
        connection to the main website and evoke a sense of familiarity.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p> To emphasize uniqueness, I opted for a single unique font, ensuring it would stand out amidst a sea of minimal
        typography styles.
        For the remaining text, I chose a palette of simple yet vibrant colors, aligning with the event's aesthetics.
        Within the design, I integrated multiple clickable links, each crucial for users to grasp essential information:
        details about the artist, event location, Canadian Cultural Center, and insights into the event program..<br>
        <br>
